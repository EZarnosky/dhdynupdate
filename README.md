# DreamHost Dynamic DNS Record Update

`dhdynupdate` is a Python 3 utility for Linux. Other operating systems may
work, but have not been tested.

The purpose of `dhdynupdate` is similar to a number of dynamic DNS updaters on
the internet: to update DNS records with IP addresses for your local machine
for a domain hosted by [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com), using the
[DreamHost API](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Application_programming_interface).

## Features ##

* `dhdynupdate` supports updating both A and AAAA (IPv4 and IPv6) addresses.
* DNS records are updated on an as-needed basis to avoid sending unnecessary
DreamHost API calls
* `dhdynupdate` always verifies & updates the DNS records for the configured
hostname upon d√¶mon instantiation
    * From there, `dhdynupdate` check your local IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.
    * If a IPv4/IPv6 address changes, `dhdynupdate` will update the
      corresponding entry in your DreamHost DNS Zone.

`dhdynupdate` uses the following external modules:

* [`daemon`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/)
    * Available in Debian/Ubuntu as `python3-daemon`
* [`netifaces`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces)
    * Available in Debian/Ubuntu as `python3-netifaces`
* [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
    * Available in Debian/Ubuntu as `python3-requests`

# Configuration
Configuration goes in `dhdynupdate.conf`, and is in the [Python 'config' file format.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure)

The default config has a couple of sections:

##`Global`
This section has global configuration options:

* Network interfaces to update the DNS records for
* [The DreamHost Web API URL](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Application_programming_interface), and the logfile location.

##`DreamHost API Test Account`

* Uses The DreamHost test API key
* Only allows read-only operations
* It's a useful example to show the file format as well as a harmless test

##`your.domain.name`

* Insert `your.domain.name` for the name of your domain name.
* Also put in your DreamHost API key.

        [Global]
        # The DreamHost API URL; doubtful it'll change
        api_url = https://api.dreamhost.com/
        # External IPv4 and IPv6 interface to use
        # Separated as the subnet provided by my ISP is on a different interface
        # than the routing IP on my external interface.
        ipv6_if = eth0
        ipv4_if = eth1
        # Log file
        log_file = dhdynupdate.log
        # The update interval (in seconds)
        # for reference, 1h = 3600 s
        update_interval = 3600

        [DreamHost API Test Account]
        api_key = 6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM
        local_hostname = ssh.thebesthostever.com

        [your.domain.name]
        api_key=6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM
        local_hostname = a6.groo.com

# Generating a DreamHost API Key

If you don't already have an appropriate API key:

* [Generate a new API key:](https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=home.api)
    * Make sure that `dns-*` is checked
    * Make sure *everything else* is unchecked

# TODO:

* `systemd` unit files
* Proper [Python packaging](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* Distro packages
